# Overview

For this project, I create a web-based to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

The software described above is a simple web-based to-do list application that demonstrates various aspects of the JavaScript language. Here's an overview of its features and functionalities:

* Basic Functionality:
Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list by typing into an input field and clicking an "Add Task" button.
Task Display: Added tasks are displayed in a list format on the webpage.

* Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., line-through styling).

* HTML Structure:
The application uses basic HTML elements such as a heading (h2), input field (input), button (button), and an unordered list (ul) to display tasks.

* CSS Styling:
The styling enhances the visual appeal and user experience. It includes styles for the body, heading, input field, button, and tasks. Features like hover effects on buttons and tasks improve interactivity.

* JavaScript Interactivity:
Dynamic List Manipulation: JavaScript is used to dynamically add tasks to the list based on user input.
Event Handling: JavaScript handles click events for adding tasks and toggling their completion status.
Exception Handling: The application demonstrates basic exception handling in JavaScript. For example, it throws and catches exceptions for input validation (e.g., ensuring the task input is not empty).

* Predefined Tasks (in the extended version):
The application can be preloaded with a set of predefined tasks, demonstrating how JavaScript can be used to render static data into HTML elements.

* Robust User Feedback:
The application provides user feedback through alerts in case of exceptions and visual cues for task interactions.

* Stretch Challenges (suggested improvements):
Ideas for extending the application include adding task editing, prioritizing tasks, data persistence (using local storage or a backend), and user authentication.
This application is an excellent example for beginners to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together in web development. It covers basic concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content generation, providing a practical context to learn and apply JavaScript.

This is for practicing purpose using javascript.

# Development Environment

* Code Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
Visual Studio Code: A popular, lightweight code editor with support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a vast extension library for additional functionalities like live server, code linting, and version control integration.
* Web Browser with Developer Tools:
Google Chrome: Known for its extensive DevTools for debugging JavaScript, inspecting elements, and testing responsive design.
* Version Control System:
Git: A widely-used version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development.
GitHub or GitLab: Online platforms that host your Git repositories and provide tools for collaboration, issue tracking, and code review.
* Local Server Environment (for testing):
Live Server Extension for VS Code: An extension for Visual Studio Code that launches a local development server with live reload feature for static and dynamic pages.
